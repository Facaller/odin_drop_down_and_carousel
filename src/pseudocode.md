You're thinking about this the right way conceptuallyâ€”great work so far. Let's walk through your approach and refine the strategy, step by step, without giving you actual code (per your request):

ðŸ”§ Your Goal:
You want a carousel that:

Shows only one slide at a time, despite the .slide-wrapper containing all four slides.

Lets users navigate using arrows.

Has dots for navigation feedback.

ðŸ§  How to Think About Structuring This
1. Contain vs. Scroll
Right now, your .slide-wrapper is super wide (3000px), enough to fit multiple slides in one row. Thatâ€™s only useful if you're planning to scroll horizontally inside a fixed-width container.

So your instinct is almost correct, but hereâ€™s the nuance:

You donâ€™t need to hide .slide-wrapper entirely (display: none), because it holds all the content.

Instead, you want the container (.carousel-container) to act as a viewport, only showing one slide's worth of width at a time.

Then, you'll translate/shift the .slide-wrapper left or right to reveal the correct slide.

2. Overflow & Hidden Slides
To show just one slide at a time:

The container (.carousel-container or the middle cell holding the .slide-wrapper) needs **overflow: hidden**.

This will clip the extra width from the .slide-wrapper, so only part of it (one slide) is visible.

3. Sliding Behavior
Think of .slide-wrapper like a film strip:

Youâ€™ll move it left or right using CSS transforms (e.g., translateX).

Each click of the arrow will update a position index, and move the wrapper accordingly.

4. Flex Use
Using display: flex in .slide-wrapper is goodâ€”this lets all your .slide elements line up horizontally, which is what you want for a horizontal carousel.

5. Arrow Positioning
Your arrow positioning might need tweaking:

Right now, theyâ€™re position: absolute using % values, which can be unpredictable.

Since you're using a CSS grid for layout, try letting them live in their grid columns and adjust their placement via grid alignment insteadâ€”this is cleaner and more maintainable.

6. Responsive Thinking
You're hardcoding widths (e.g., 3000px, 800px). Thatâ€™s fine for now, but long-term, think about:

Making .slide have a consistent width (say, 800px).

Making .slide-wrapper width = slideCount * slideWidth, dynamically.

Using units like % or vw to keep things responsive.

7. CSS Classes
Your class names are good and descriptive. Just be mindful of styling conflicts (as you saw earlier), and continue using unique, contextual names.

âœ… Next Steps
Hereâ€™s how to move forward:

Adjust layout so only one slide is visible:

Set a fixed width on .carousel-container (e.g., 800px).

Give .slide-wrapper a wide width (e.g., 4 * 800px).

Set overflow: hidden on the container.

Use JS later to:

Track the current slide index.

Move .slide-wrapper using transform: translateX(-index * slideWidth).

Test it incrementally:

Start with just two slides and confirm the scroll works.

Then build up to more slides, arrows, and dot indicators.
