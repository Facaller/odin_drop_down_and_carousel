If you ever want to:

Pause the timer on interaction (like dot or arrow clicks),

Resume it afterward,

Or reset the timer when a user manually changes the slide,

…you can expand this with clearInterval() and store the timer ID.

But as it stands now—this is a solid, clean implementation. Nice work!
